Last year I posted an animation created in R to celebrate the new year, and this year I've got a more fabulous animation. Unfortunately our Lord of CRAN (Kurt) has been out of office for several days, so I'm unable to publish my [animation package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html) on CRAN as scheduled. Anyway, for those who are curious about the new version the `animation` package, you can [download the version 2.0-0 from my GitHub development page](https://github.com/yihui/animation).

The above animation comes from the `demo('fireworks')` in the R package `animation` 2.0-0. Thanks for the contribution of Weicheng Zhu.

Another demo I did not mention on this Christmas was `demo('Xmas2')`:

Thanks for the contribution of Jing Jiao.

There are a whole bunch of new features in the `animation` package v2.0-0 (this version is a milestone), but I will keep silent for the time being, since it is not published on CRAN yet.
