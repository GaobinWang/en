This afternoon I went to the Beijing Custom to give a lecture on sampling techniques as well as my R program. Actually I didn't make any preparations until late in this morning. When I finished my lunch, I made some animated pictures to illustrate these four kinds of sampling methods: [simple random sampling](http://yihui.name/r/stat/sampling_survey/simple_random/index.htm), [stratified sampling](http://yihui.name/r/stat/sampling_survey/stratified/index.htm), [cluster sampling](http://yihui.name/r/stat/sampling_survey/cluster/index.htm) and [systematic sampling](http://yihui.name/r/stat/sampling_survey/systematic/index.htm).

After I came back to school, I added these animations to my little project "[Animated Statistics Using R](http://yihui.name/r)". You may see them [here](http://yihui.name/r/stat/sampling_survey/index.htm).
